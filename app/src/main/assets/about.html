<h3>Structural Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        I implemented swipe navigation for the app. Three pages exist:
        a pm2.5 sensor page, data history page, and an about page.
    </li>
    <li>
        I added buttons to the swipe navigation feature to allow
        easier control depending on the device that is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        The pm2.5 sensor page now has a moving graph that shows
        the data updating live.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bluetooth Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A lost connection to the device will return the user to the
        bluetooth connection page.
    </li>
    <li>
        A thread for the Bluetooth connection routine.
        User experience is no longer interrupted by this slow task.
    </li>
    <li>
        A timer task that updates the device list every few seconds.
        Now the user does not need to hit a button to refresh the list.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Storage Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Began implementing data storage, but this feature is only
        partially complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        The data history page shows some test data on a graph. This is
        a proof of concept for my data storage class "PMBTFileService".
    </li>
</ul>
